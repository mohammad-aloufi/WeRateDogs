# Introduction

This project is about a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

# More info

In this project, I'll be gathering data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness to make it as clean as possible.

After then I'll be doing some analysis on it.

# Note

I fixed 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues in those datasets. The datasets are still messy to be honest. Cleaning them 100% would take forever and I just cleaned what I could and to the extent that's enough for my data analysis.
There is a lot of cleaning left to be done.
